# Excel Data Analysis Projects
A collection of Excel-based data analysis and visualization projects designed to explore insights, identify trends, and communicate findings effectively.

## Adventure Works Data Analysis Project
This project utilizes the Adventure Works dataset to perform comprehensive analysis in three key areas: time series analysis, product performance, and customer behavior. An interactive and visually compelling dashboard was created using Excel's advanced data analysis tools.

### Key Excel Features Used
- Power Query: Used to clean, transform, and combine data from multiple sources.
- Power Pivot & Relationships: Established relationships between different tables to create a dynamic data model.
- DAX Formulas: Applied Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create calculated measures and perform advanced aggregations.
- Excel Functions: Utilized various functions to add logic and depth to the analysis.
- Data Visualizations: Developed clear and informative charts to support storytelling and highlight insights.
